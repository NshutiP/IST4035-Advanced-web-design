                    Serene Stay was founded in 2011 by the Beyond Travels Association which seeks to promote
                    a healthy and enjoyable lifestyle through their various ventures in spas, yoga clubs and
                    gyms.

                <p class="about-us"> 
                    Serene Stay has always sought to be a safe haven for those who are overwhelmed,
                    stressed and need an escape from the outside world. This is why we have a strict policy
                    of no technological devices. 
                </p>
                
                <p class="about-us">
                    We seek to help guests deepen their connection with nature and themselves through staying 
                    with us. We provide a transcendent experience that rejuvenates and re-energizes our guests.
