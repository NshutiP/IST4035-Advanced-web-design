            Serene Stay was founded in 2011 by the Beyond Travels Association which seeks to promote <br>
            a healthy and enjoyable lifestyle through their various ventures in spas, yoga clubs and <br>
            gyms. Serene Stay has always sought to be a safe haven for those who are overwhelmed, <br>
            stressed and need an escape from the outside world. This is why we have a strict policy <br>
            of no technological devices. We seek to help guests deepen their connection with nature <br>
            and themselves through staying with us. We provide a transcendent experience that <br>
            rejuvenates and re-energizes our guests.
